# Obelyx
**Obelyx** is a self hosted game backlog manager that helps users organize, track, and view their game collections.

## Overview
**Obelyx** is a locally hosted suite of tools designed to help users manage their game libraries and keep track of what they’re playing, finished, or planning to start, similar in spirit to *MyAnimeList* or *IMDb*, but focused on games.

**Obelyx** lets users:
* Log and categorize their games
* Track backlog status and other useful stats
* Record personal notes or thoughts
* Search and filter through their collection

## Tech Stack
### Backend
- **C#**
- **.NET 8**
- **SQL Server**
- **REST API architechture**

### Frontend
- **React (Vite)**
- **JavaScript**
- **Sass**

## Project Goals
The goal of **Obelyx** is to provide a locally hosted and customizable way to manage your game backlog, without relying on third-party websites or cumbersome spreadsheets.

**Obelyx** is built with privacy and personalization in mind. All data is stored locally on your machine and can be freely modified to suit your needs. The self-hosted web interface offers a visual and intuitive way to explore your gaming history.

The development of Obelyx was guided by a simple vision: 

>*Build a self-hosted program using modern .NET, REST APIs, and a React-based frontend that can replace my current backlog tracking in Google Sheets.*

## Why "Obelyx"? 
The name **Obelyx** comes from *Obelisk* — a monument that, much like your game backlog, stands the test of time. 

Conquering it is an adventure in itself, not unlike building the monuments of old. It takes patience, motivation, and the drive to overcome even the smallest challenges life throws your way.
